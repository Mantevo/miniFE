This variant uses NVIDIAs NVAMG for solving the Sparse problem. Note that NVAMG has to be available. 
In order to compile gcc 4.7 or later is required. 
Copy config files from the configs subfolder to NVAMG_CONFIG in order to change the used solver routines from NVAMG.
Note that the timings reported in the yaml file are not fully correct: The CG Time includes the whole setup of
the NVAMG library, waxpby and dot product time are essentially zero, because the CG solve is done with a call
to a solve library.
